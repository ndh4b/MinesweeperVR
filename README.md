The following will be a detailed step-by-step analysis of how to create a similar project to this one. We will be using <cyan> Unreal Engine</cyan> and <cyan> Blender</cyan> to create our vision of a VR game similar to Minesweeper. 
  
<green> FIRST! </green>Check to make sure your hardware meets the requirements to run Unreal Engine. You can find out by checking the [SPECS](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/hardware-and-software-specifications-for-unreal-engine/).

Sweet! Now we should <green> START DOWNLOADING!</green>

The first software you should download is <cyan> Blender</cyan>. You can use this to create 3D renderings of objects that can be added into <cyan> Unreal Engine</cyan>. To download blender, go [here](https://www.blender.org/download/).

The next step is to go ahead and get the epic games launcher. [Epic Download](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download).

Now, from inside of the Epic Games launcher, find the <cyan> Unreal Engine</cyan> tab and then you can find the install option from that screen.
