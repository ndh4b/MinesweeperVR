The following will be a detailed step-by-step analysis of how to create a similar project to this one. We will be using **Unreal Engine** and **Blender** to create our vision of a VR game similar to Minesweeper. 
  
**FIRST!** Check to make sure your hardware meets the requirements to run Unreal Engine. You can find out by checking the [SPECS](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/hardware-and-software-specifications-for-unreal-engine/).

Sweet! *Now* we should START DOWNLOADING!

The *first* software you should download is Blender. You can use this to create 3D renderings of objects that can be added into Unreal Engine. To download blender, go [here](https://www.blender.org/download/).

The next step is to go ahead and get the epic games launcher. [Epic Download](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download).

Now, from *inside* of the Epic Games launcher, find the  Unreal Engine tab and then you can find the install option from that screen.

After everything is installed you can begin your project and begin creating. The material contained within this git repository will ***not*** be enough to completely replicate our project. 

Rather, you will find some object files that we have created and some sample packs that we downloaded for *free*.

It should be noted there will be plenty of editing and logic that will be required of you to ensure that elements within *your own project* can interact with each other seamlessly.

Inside the repo you will also find the various objects that have been created by members of the team here this weekend at HackMT. Everyone's name will be mentioned in the presentation if you would like to see a list of the participants!
