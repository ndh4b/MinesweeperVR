# MinesweeperVR
### Hack MT project

---

The following will be a detailed step-by-step analysis of how to create a similar project to this one. We will be using <mark>Unreal Engine</mark> and <mark>Blender</mark> to create our vision of a VR game similar to Minesweeper. 
  
**FIRST!** Check to make sure your hardware meets the requirements to run Unreal Engine. You can find out by checking the [SPECS](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/hardware-and-software-specifications-for-unreal-engine/).

Sweet! *Now* we should START DOWNLOADING!

The *first* software you should download is Blender. You can use this to create 3D renderings of objects that can be added into Unreal Engine. To download blender, go [here](https://www.blender.org/download/).

The next step is to go ahead and get the epic games launcher. [Epic Download](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/download).

Now, from *inside* of the Epic Games launcher, find the  Unreal Engine tab and then you can find the install option from that screen.
